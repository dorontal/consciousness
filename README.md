# consciousness/README.md

This repository contains Doron Tal's thoughts toward a theory of
consciousness.

For a start, all thoughts, ideas, arguments are in this file. If need
be, this file will be forked off into other files and that would be
mentioned in this file.

## Axioms

Start with the following axioms:

1. Every "thing" in the universe is "connected"

2. Every "thing" in the universe is in constant "flux" (the only thing
   that is constant in the universe is change)

## Theory of consciousness

Now draw a circle around any collection of "things" in the universe.
For example, take one collection of things to be the skin of a human
and everything contained within it. Call that collection a "human".

Consciousness of a human, then, is the consciousness of what's inside
this circle.

### The crux

Consciousness is "relationship" - between what's inside the circle and
what's outside of it.

Done. Well, almost.

### Further work needed

Now we need to define some of those abstract terms more clearly. The
terms we need to define more clearly are:

* "thing"

* "connected"

* "flux" or "change"

* "relationship

### Implications of this theory

* One implication is that there are numerous such "circles" that can
  be drawn.  Any combination/collection of things in the universe is
  just another circle. Therefore, if there are infinitely many things
  in the universe, there are infinitely many circles.

* If there are finitely many things in the universe, the number of
  collections you can form out of them is still a much larger number
  than the number of things in the universe.

* A major implication is that anything you draw a circle around: a
  human, a stone, a circle that encompasses part of the human and part
  of a stone - is conscious. Everything is conscious.

* Another implication is that our concept of a human is just a
  concept, just one of the numeous (possibly infinite) many circles we
  can draw.

# consciousness/README.md

This repository contains my (Doron Tal's) thoughts toward a theory of
consciousness.

For a start, all thoughts, ideas, arguments are in this `README.md`
file. If need be, this file will be forked off into other files and
that would be mentioned in this file.

## Axioms

Start with the following axioms:

1. Every "thing" in the universe is "connected".
2. Every "thing" in the universe is in constant "flux" (the only thing
that is constant in the universe is change).

## Theory of consciousness

Now draw a circle around any collection of "things" in the universe.
For example, take one collection of things to be the skin of a human
and everything contained within it. Call that collection a "human".

Consciousness of a human, then, is the consciousness of what's inside this circle.

Consciousness is "relationship" - between what's inside the circle and what's outside of it.

Done!

Now to defining some of those abstract terms more clearly. The terms we need to define more clearly are:
* "thing"
* "connected"
* "flux" or "change"
* "relationship

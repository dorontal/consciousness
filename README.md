# consciousness/README.md

This file contains thoughts toward a theory of consciousness.

For a start, all thoughts, ideas, arguments are in this file.

#### Caveat

All of the ideas here are completely ad-hoc and arbitrary. This is
just a game, at first, to see if a coherent theory can be concocted
from a few ad-hoc assumptions, a theory that nonetheless resists some
of the common problems with other theories of consciousness out there.


## Theory of consciousness

Start with the following axioms:

1. Every "thing" in the universe is "connected" to every other "thing"

2. Every "thing" in the universe is in constant "flux" (the only thing
   that is constant in the universe is "flux", or "change")

Now draw a "circle" around any collection of "things". For example,
take one collection of things to be the skin of some specific human as
it is right now, and include in your circle everything contained
within the skin; call that collection a "human".  By 'consciousness of
a human', then, we are referring to the consciousness of what's inside
this circle.

### Consciousness is "relationship"

Consciousness is "relationship" - between what's inside the circle and
what's outside of it.

Done? Not quite:

### Further work needed

Now we need to define some of those abstract terms more clearly. The
terms we need to define more clearly are:

* "circle"

* "thing"

* "connected"

* "flux" (or "change")

* "relationship"

### Implications and related notes

* By "circle" we don't literally mean a 2D circle, just any collection
  of things

* There are numerous "circles" that can be drawn.  Any
  combination/collection of things in the universe is just another
  circle. Therefore, if there are infinitely many things in the
  universe, there are infinitely many circles you can draw. Even if
  there are finitely many things in the universe, the number of
  collections you can form out of them is still a much larger number
  than the number of things in the universe.

* Implication: Anything you draw a circle around: a human, a stone, a
  circle that encompasses part of the human and part of a stone - is
  conscious, because it's going to have some relationship to the stuff
  outside the circle. It's going to have some relationship to the
  stuff outside the circle because everything is connected to
  everything else. Therefore, things inside any circle you may draw
  are always going to be connected to things outside the circle.

* A human is just one of many possible circles we can draw in the
  universe. If every circle is conscious, then there is nothing
  special about the consciousness of a human, or about the concept of
  human consciousness.

* Due to the connectedness axiom, whenever some thing changes, it
  causes a change in every other thing. So whenever something outside
  of the circle changes, it causes a change in that which is inside
  the circle.  This is the beginning of the definition or explanation
  of "relationship".

* Since everything is in flux, what's inside the circle is in flux and
  what's outside of it is in flux. The circle itself is also in
  flux.

* Under these assumptions and axioms, everything you can define in the
  universe as a thing or a collection of things is conscious.

* "Everthing in flux" implies no self. The concept of self requires
  there to be no flux: "self" implies something that does not change
  in time.  We may feel that we have a non-changing self, but that
  would have to be an illusion.

* Consciousness is a process of "relationship" - relationship that is
  also in flux.

* One question that arises is whether there are "levels" of
  consciousness, perhaps related to levels of complexity, or
  organization of the system, or to entropy in a system.

### Problems with this theory

1. So far, this theory does not explain the difference between
   conscious and not conscious, e.g, the difference between
   consciousness present in a human who is awake vs consciousness
   absent in a human who is asleep. What makes something not conscious
   or less conscious? How do we explain such distinctions? This theory
   does not explain such differences, it says that everything is
   conscious but does not mention whether anything is more conscious
   than any other. 

   * This theory does not even addresss the topic of "degrees of
     consciousness". Under this theory, there is no reason for one
     thing to be considered more conscious than another, there is no
     difference between the consciousness of an atom and that of a
     human. Consciousness is just that constantly changing
     relationship between things inside the circle and outside of it.
     One cannot quantify such relationships in the sense of saying
     that there is more of a relationship in one collection of things
     vs another. You could say that one collection of things is more
     organized, has less entropy than another collection. But this
     theory does not ascribe more consciousness to systems that are
     more highly organized. Such systems are still just a collection
     of things and the things in the collection will be connected to
     all things in and out of the collection and it is that connection
     or relationship that emobdies the consciousness of the system.

   * Just the fact that one doesn't remember their mental states
     during sleep does not imply that they were not conscious
     then. If, as this theory holds, everything is conscious, every
     circle you draw, then there is no such thing as "not
     conscious". Lack of consciousness then might be some sort of
     illusion. Perhaps that illusion is related to memory: when you
     were asleep you were conscious but you just can't remember that
     you were.


<!--
     Your memory of the conscious experience is wiped out so quickly
       before the next conscious moment, that you cannot hang on to
       any of those moments - before you know it, there's another one.
       This answer would require consciousness to be something that
       arises and ceases very rapidly. This can be consistent with
       "everything is connected", in this sense: when something in the
       universe arises, it creates the conditions for a moment of
       consciousness. When something in the universe ceases to exist,
       the consciousness that arose when it arose also ceases.

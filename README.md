# consciousness/README.md

This file contains thoughts toward a theory of consciousness.

For a start, all thoughts, ideas, arguments are in this file.

## Theory of consciousness

Start with the following axioms:

1. Every "thing" in the universe is "connected" to every other "thing"

2. Every "thing" in the universe is in constant "flux" (the only thing
   that is constant in the universe is "flux", or "change")

Now draw a "circle" around any collection of "things". For example,
take one collection of things to be the skin of some specific human as
it is right now, and include in your circle everything contained
within the skin; call that collection a "human".  By 'consciousness of
a human', then, we are referring to the consciousness of what's inside
this circle.

### Consciousness is "relationship"

Consciousness is "relationship" - between what's inside the circle and
what's outside of it.

Done? Not quite:

### Further work needed

Now we need to define some of those abstract terms more clearly. The
terms we need to define more clearly are:

* "circle"

* "thing"

* "connected"

* "flux" (or "change")

* "relationship

### Implications and related notes

* There are numerous such "circles" that can be drawn.  Any
  combination/collection of things in the universe is just another
  circle. Therefore, if there are infinitely many things in the
  universe, there are infinitely many circles you can draw. Even if
  there are finitely many things in the universe, the number of
  collections you can form out of them is still a much larger number
  than the number of things in the universe.

* Anything you draw a circle around: a human, a stone, a circle that
  encompasses part of the human and part of a stone - is
  conscious. Everything you can define in the universe as a thing or a
  collection of things is conscious.

* A human is just one of many possible circles. If every circle is
  conscious, then there is nothing special about the consciousness of
  a human, or about the concept of a human - that's just one circle.

* Due to the connectedness axiom, whenever some thing changes, it
  causes a change in every other thing. So whenever something outside
  of the circle changes, it causes a change in that which is inside
  the circle.  This is the beginning of the definition or explanation
  of "relationship".

* Since everything is in flux, what's inside the circle is in flux and
  what's outside of it is in flux. The circle itself is also in
  flux. This, for the example of a circle denoting a human above,
  implies that what is a human at one point in time is not the same
  human at another point in time. In reality, there is no "self" that
  remains the same for any human or any thing in the universe.

* We may feel that we have a non-changing self, but that would have to
  be an illusion.

* Consciousness is a process of "relationship" that is also in flux.

* One question that arises is whether there are "levels" of
  consciousness, perhaps related to levels of complexity, or
  organization, or order in a system.


### Problems with this theory

* **Big problem:** So far, this theory does not explain the difference
  between conscious and not conscious, e.g, the difference between
  consciousness being present in a human who is awake and absent in a
  human who is asleep. If everything is conscious, okay, but what
  makes something not conscious?

# consciousness/README.md

This repository contains thoughts toward a theory of consciousness.

For a start, all thoughts, ideas, arguments are to be written in this
file. If need be, this file will be forked off into other files and
that would be mentioned in this file.

## Theory of consciousness

We start with the following axioms:

1. Every "thing" in the universe is "connected"

2. Every "thing" in the universe is in constant "flux" (the only thing
   that is constant in the universe is change)

Now draw a "circle" around any collection of "things" in the universe.
Here, a "circle" denotes any collection of things. Think of Venn
diagrams: if the universe is one big circle, the circles we are
referring to here are inside of it.  For example, take one collection
of things to be the skin of some human right now and everything
contained within it. Call that collection a "human".  By
'consciousness of a human', then, we are referring to the
consciousness of what's inside this circle.

### Consciousness is "relationship"

Consciousness is "relationship" - between what's inside the circle and
what's outside of it.

Done. Well, almost.

### Further work needed

Now we need to define some of those abstract terms more clearly. The
terms we need to define more clearly are:

* "circle"

* "thing"

* "connected"

* "flux" (or "change")

* "relationship

### Implications

* One implication is that there are numerous such "circles" that can
  be drawn.  Any combination/collection of things in the universe is
  just another circle. Therefore, if there are infinitely many things
  in the universe, there are infinitely many circles you can
  draw. Even if there are finitely many things in the universe, the
  number of collections you can form out of them is still a much
  larger number than the number of things in the universe.

* Anything you draw a circle around: a human, a stone, a circle that
  encompasses part of the human and part of a stone - is
  conscious. Everything you can define in the universe as a thing or a
  collection of things is conscious.

* A human is just one of many possible circles. If every circle is
  conscious, then there is nothing special about the consciousness of
  a human, or about the concept of a human - that's just one circle.

* Since everything is in flux, what's inside the circle is in
  flux, what's outside of it is in flux also. The circle itself is
  not constant, it is in flux.

* Due to the connectedness axiom, whenever some thing changes, it
  causes a change in every other thing. So whenever something outside
  of the circle changes, it causes a change in that which is inside
  the circle.  This is the beginning of the definition or explanation
  of "relationship".

* One question that arises is whether there are "levels" of
  consciousness, perhaps related to levels of complexity, or
  organization, or order in a system.
